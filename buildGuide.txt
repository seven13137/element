## Getting Started

1. Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

2.Run  ```npm install``` from the folder where the code will be downloaded (with package.json)

3.Run ```npm install -g grunt-cli

4.Install [bower(>v1.5)](http://bower.io/#install-bower) (or`npm install -g bower')

5.Install [bower-art-resolver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower-art-resolver#installation) (or`npm install -g bower-art-resolver`)

6.Run 'bower install` in the seed project folder

7.Run `grunt`

8.Run `grunt connect`

9.Browse "http://localhost:10000/dist/index.html"

10.Every time you change the code, such as adding pages or modifying code, 
you can regrunt the project in the folder where the project is located.

11.Once again, the project only needs to find the folder where the project is located,
 and the background input "grunt" -> "grunt connect" can open the page in the browser.
